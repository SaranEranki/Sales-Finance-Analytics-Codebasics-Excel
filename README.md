# üìä AtliQ Hardware: Sales & Finance Analytics

## üè¢ Project Overview 

AtliQ Hardware (Imaginary Company) is a manufacturer and seller of various hardware products, including mice, printers, PCs, and more. The company produces hardware and distributes it to retailers such as Croma and Staples, as well as online platforms like Amazon and Flipkart. These retailers then sell the products to end consumers. For some countries having Government regulations, AtliQ sends to local distributors for further sales. In addition, It also has its own Stores.

As a Junior Data analyst in Data Analytics Team at AtliQ Hardware, I was given the task of creating various insightful reports using advanced Excel techniques, to address the problem of cluttered Excel files where data is scattered, causing inaccuracies, inability to find patterns, and delays in decision-making.
